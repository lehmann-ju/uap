.. title:: Results: Annotation Files

..
  This document aims to describe how to use **uap** via the command-line.

Annotation Files
****************

The annotation files contain detailed information about every output file.
Also, the Git SHA1 hash of the **uap** repository at the time of
data processing is included.
The executed commands are listed.
Annotation contains information about inter-process streams and output files,
including SHA1 and SHA256 checksums, file sizes, and line counts as well.


Upon successful completion of a task, an extensive YAML-formatted annotation 
is placed next to the output files in a file called 
``.[task_id]-annotation.yaml``.
Also, for every output file, a symbolic link to this file is created:
``.[output_filename].annotation.yaml``.

Finally, the annotation is rendered via GraphViz, if available.
Rendering can also be done at a later time using annotations as input (see
**uap**'s :ref:`render<uap-render>` subcommand).
The annotation can be used to determine at a later time what exactly happened.
Also, annotations may help to identify bottlenecks.

known_paths
-----------

Contains information about all directories/files used during processing a run.
uap calculates the SHA256 hexdigest for each known file with the designation 'output' aka.
output/result files.
